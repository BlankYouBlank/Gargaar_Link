Project Overview
Gargaar-Link is a decentralized health logistics command center designed specifically for the rural landscape of Somaliland. Traditional inventory systems often fail in remote areas due to poor internet connectivity. Gargaar-Link solves this by using an Offline-First architecture, allowing health officers to manage life-saving supplies without a constant server connection.

The system transforms raw data into a Geospatial Intelligence tool, pinpointing exactly where Oxygen, Vaccines, and Antibiotics are running low, and providing one-click communication bridges to national coordinators.

Key Technical Features
Geospatial Mapping: Real-time visualization of health posts using Leaflet.js, color-coded by emergency status.

Offline Data Persistence: High-performance data management using browser LocalStorage, ensuring zero downtime during internet outages.

Intelligent Alerting: Automated threshold logic that triggers audible and visual alerts when stock levels drop below safety margins.

WhatsApp Emergency Bridge: One-click generation of pre-formatted incident reports sent directly to logistics coordinators.

Redistribution Logic: An algorithmic advisor that suggests stock transfers from surplus zones to critical shortage areas.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Custom Variables & Dark Mode support)

Logic: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

Mapping: Leaflet.js

Analytics: Chart.js

Alerting: Web Audio API

 Why this Project Matters
In emergency healthcare, information delay equals lives lost. Gargaar-Link removes the delay by digitizing the supply chain at the "last mile," ensuring that no village goes "dark" during a medical shortage.
